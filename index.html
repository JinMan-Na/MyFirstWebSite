  <h2>WEB 이란 무엇인가 2 ?</h2>

  <p>
  We are excited to announce an open position (possibly part-time) : Automotive & Transportation Champion, based in the USA or China, or Japan.
  This is an opportunity for a global leader to drive the overall strategy of applying open web standards to the automotive & transportation ecosystem. The Champion is a thought leader who has a deep understanding of the needs of the automotive industry and a working understanding of web technology. The Champion engages with other automotive thought leaders from W3C Members and with technologists in W3C. By bringing these groups together, the Champion identifies new technology needs for the industry and identifies technical and business approaches to satisfy those needs.
